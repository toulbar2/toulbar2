toulbar2 can be used as a stand-alone solver reading various problem file formats (wcsp, uai, wcnf, qpbo) or as a C++ library.

This document describes the WCSP native file format and the toulbar2 C++ library API.

Note
  Use cmake flags LIBTB2=ON and TOULBAR2_ONLY=OFF to get the toulbar2 C++
  library libtb2.so and toulbar2test executable example.
