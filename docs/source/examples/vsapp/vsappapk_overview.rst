.. Overview of Visual Sudoku Application as APK

The application allows to capture a grid from its own camera (*'CAMERA' menu*)
or to select a grid among the smartphone existing files (*'FILE' menu*), for
example files coming from 'DCIM', in .jpg or .png formats. The grid image must
have been captured in portrait orientation. Once the grid has been chosen, the
*'Solve'* button allows to get the solution.
